# About
## [COVID-19 Data Challenge: Navigating Life and Work in Border Communities](https://mexico.ucsd.edu/initiatives/border-solutions/data-challenge.html)
Communities along the U.S.-Mexico border have been hard hit by COVID-19. While researchers race to develop a vaccine, life and work must continue. How can we confidently and transparently decide what is safe? Can we more efficiently mine existing data and/or gather new data for analysis to assess the risks of activities in different spheres of life, and thus more effectively direct resources and interventions? Specifically, how can we better understand risk levels in real-time for different situations and communicate them to the public?
